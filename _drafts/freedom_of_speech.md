In 1977 Frank Collin, then leader of the National Socialist Party of America,
made plans to hold a Nazi rally in Skokie, Illinois, a largely Jewish suburb
of Chicago.  The town made a number of attempts to prevent the demonstration
by legal means.  The ACLU famously defended the Nazis on the grounds that the
their right to freedom of speech could not be infringed no matter how crass or
offensive the demonstration was intended to be.  The former president of the
ACLU and lead defender of the Nazis, Aryeh Neier, wrote a book, Defending My
Enemy, detailing that particular case and many like it.  In the book Neier
defends the ACLU's decision on both legal and moral grounds.  Neier carefully
explains the legal precidents of cases involving the First Amendment.  The
number of exceptions given for a US citizen's freedom of speech are
surpisingly many and technical, and Neier, an accomplished lawyer, does a good
job of outlining them and explaining why even the most offensive speech is
still protected under the law.  I won't bother trying to summarize these
arguments.  Instead, I would like to focus on the moral argument for
protecting an individual's freedom of speech.

Neier summarizes the moral argument thusly:

> Government can not claim to enjoy the consent of the governed if it places
> restraints on what they say.  Only a society that permits people to speak
> can justly impose on them the decisions of the majority.  The rule of the
> majority has no claim on the loyalty of the minority unless the minority has
> its chance to influence others and, thereby, to become the majority.  How
> can we know if the minority has truth and virtue on its side unless its
> views are permitted to grapple with others in a free and open encounter?
> How can we suppress violence by minorities unless our government enjoys the
> legitimacy that derives from the consent it has obtained from the
> governed?[^1]

In order to legitimately rule by the consent of the governed, the government
(the majority) must not prevent the exercise of freedom of speech by any
minority.  If it did, then the minority would have no recourse to govern
themselves except by volient resistence which would obviously undermine
democratic rule.  There a couple of assumptions implicit in the argument that
are worth exploring.

First, Neier assumes (based on the first question) that in a fair fight
between truth and falsehood, truth will win out.  This view is also supported
by Thomas Jefferson[^2] and John Milton[^3] whom Neier quotes in his book, but
I find the view a bit naive.  The winner of such a fight is determined by
human minds, and I do not have so high an opinion of human judgement (mine
included) to assume that just because an idea has won the support of the mob,
it must be right.  However, I am willing to concede that it is *far more
likely* that the real Truth will win if all criticisms and counter-arguments
of established "truths" are considered.  (I will discuss this a bit more
further on.)

[^2]: "If there be any among us who would wish to dissolve this Union or to
change its Republican form, let them stand undisturbed as monuments of the
safety with which error of opinion may be tolerated where reason is left free
to combat it."

[^3]: "Though all the winds of doctrine were let loose to play upon the earth,
so Truth be in the field, we do injuriously by licensing and prohibiting, to
misdoubt her strength.  Let her and Falsehood grapple; who ever knew Truth put
to the worse, in a free and open encounter?"

Second, Neier's argument importantly relies on an assumption of democratic
governance.  The majority must allow the minority to speak freely in order to
have their consent to be governed.  However, Neier does not make an argument
that freedom of speech is an inalienable right, one that all men should have
regardless of the government in which they live.  As products of Western
democracy, we might just take for granted that all men should have the freedom
to voice their opinions without restraint, but the ethical justification for
this is not obvious.

Assume, for example, a society ruled by a Benevolent Philosopher-King (BPK).
The BPK does not rely on the consent of his subjects, but he does what is best
for all whom he governs.  Thus, according to Neier's argument, the BPK would
have no obligation to allow freedom of speech.  Since the BPK wants what is
best for all his subjects, can we come up with an ethical justification for
why the BPK should allow unrestrained freedom of speech?  A utilitarian
justifcation might go something along the lines of:  People will obviously
feel better if they can speak their minds without fear of punishment.  Thus,
the total utility of the society will be higher if freedom of speech is
allowed than if it is prevented.  However, from a utilitarian perspective, the
BPK would have to place limits on freedom of speech.  An individual could say
something so vile and hateful that the total utility of society would be
lowered by all the hurt feelings his words cause.  Based on this reasoning we
cannot say that unrestrained freedom of speech is an inalienable right that
all men have in all circumstances.

In both of the above arguments for freedom of speech, the freedom in question
is never claimed to be an end in itself.  In one it is a foundation of the
democratic process, and in the other it is a means to increase the good of
society.  In light of this, let us ask ourselves what ultimate goals we wish
to achieve with freedom of speech.  Like Jefferson and Milton, I think the
purpose of freedom of speech should be to arrive at truth.  As discussed
earlier, I do not think that truth *necessarily* has an advantage over
falsehood, but I think there is a pragmatic justification for believing that
freedom of speech can help us approach truth.

The human mind, for all its powers of rationality, did not evolve for the
purpose of discovering truth and as such has a number of natural biases that
can lead us to believe things which are false.  One such bias is called the
conformity bias.  The conformity bias is a tendency for individuals to behave
similarly to others in a group, even when doing so goes against their better
judgement.

Solomon Asch performed a number of experiments to study the effects of
conformity in the 1950s.  In these experiments, Asch showed a subject three
lines of different lengths -- labelled A, B, and C.  Then he showed them
another line and asked them which of A, B, or C it was the same length as.
The catch was that this subject was one of a group of other students that Asch
had coached to give the wrong answer when asked.  When the subject was asked
to give his opinion after a number of identical wrong answers had been stated,
the subject tended to agree with the previous answers even though they were
obviously wrong.  Over 30% of subjects demonstrated this behavior.  This bias
provides an explanation for why groups tend to maintain the status quo even
when a lone individual would make a better judgement.

Later Asch introduced a "partner" into his experiments, someone who would
always pick the correct answer.  In this case, subjects went with the majority
only one-fourth as often as they did without a partner.  Additionally, Asch
performed some experiments with a "dissenter".  The dissenter would differ
from the majority but would still pick a wrong answer.  When the dissenter
picked the wrong answer that was closest to correct, the effect of the
majority decision was reduced by a third.  However, when the dissenter picked
the line that was most flagrantly different from the correct answer, the
incorrect answers by the subjects under study dropped to only 9%[^4].

I believe that the results of these experiments, particularly with a
dissenter, are a pragmatic justification for unrestrained freedom of speech as
a prevention against conformity bias.  Even when someone openly makes a wrong
statement, especially when that statement is *flagrantly* wrong, it can free a
person to make their own judgement rather than relying on the wisdom of the
crowd.
