I may be a bit late to the party to discuss the importance and meaning of the
Confederate Battle Flag.  On June 17, 2015 a white supremacist shot and killed
nine members of a bible study at the historically black Emanuel AME Church in
Charleston, South Carolina.  In the wake of these horrendous murders, people
began calling for the removal of the Confederate Battle Flag from the grounds
of the South Carolina statehouse in Columbia.  This single, local movement
very quickly grew into a national movement to remove symbols of the
Confederacy from government buildings and parks throughout the South -- even
going as far as calling for the renaming of streets that bear the names of
Confederate officers.  Predictably, many Southern folk have spoken out
against the removal of Confederate symbols.  To the Southerner, the Battle
Flag represents Southern heritage, and an attack against the flag is an attack
against their identity.  This fight may have only come to national attention
in the past year, but this fight has been going on for decades.

I was born in Alabama and raised in Tennessee.  I identify as a Southerner.
The Battle Flag means a great many things to me, and nearly all of them are
positive.  I felt I needed to take a moment to express my personal feelings
about it, to offer my own perspective.  To me, like many other Southern
folk, the flag represents Southern heritage.  Most sound bites I have heard
stop there, but I think it is important to try to define "Southern heritage".
To understand this term, I think we first need to understand how the
Southerner relates himself to the rest of the nation beyond the Mason-Dixon
line.

When you are raised in the South, you become aware at a young age that most of
the US treats you as intellectually and morally inferior for no other reason
than where you grew up and the accent you hold.  In American film and
television there is no quicker or more thorough way to reveal to the audience
that a character is sexist or racist than to have him speak with a Southern
twang.  We are the butt of every joke whose punch-line involves incest or
bestiality.

As if these prejudices weren't enough, we feel that we alone carry the shame
of slavery and Jim Crow as our birthright.  We are the sin-eaters for our
national transgressions.  Our schools teach us that slavery was outlawed
across the South with the Emancipation Proclamation but not that the Union
lands of Missouri, Kentucky, West Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, and the
District of Columbia were allowed to continue the practice of slavery during
the Civil War.  Our civil rights education focuses on the riots in Southern
cities like Birmingham but not the Northern cities like Harlem and Rochester.
Segregation is presented as a Southern phenomenon without any mention of the
segregation of Chicago neighborhoods or Boston schools in the 1950's and 60's
or even the continued "informal" segregation of neighborhoods and school
systems across the nation today.

None of this is to say that the South wasn't the greatest perpetrator of these
crimes, only to say that the Southerner knows these sins belong in varying
degrees to the whole nation, and he knows that they didn't suddenly disappear
when the South was brought under the boot-heel of the North.  As a Southerner
living in the North, I get the sense that most Northern folk feel that they
can ignore their own injustices to the black community as long as they put the
blame on the South alone.

Faced with all this, Southern folk unite around our shared inferiority
complex, and we down-play our faults while we emphasize our positive
qualities.  We tell ourselves a story not about how men rebelled against their
country to maintain the institution of slavery but about individualists who
wished to defend state sovereignty against an over-reaching federal
government.  We, as well as outsiders, speak of our kindness to strangers, our
loyalty to kin, and our unrushed, easy-going attitude toward life.  And how
can a people so kind, so loyal, and so easy-going wish animosity towards
anyone on account of their race or station?

I don't say this to dismiss the Southerner's position but to try to give you
an honest glimpse into the Southern mind.  This is what the Southerner means
when he says, "Heritage not Hate".  This is the schismatic identity around
which we collectively unite, and the Confederate Battle Flag is one of the
symbols of this identity.  For the proud white Southerner, there really is no
racism associated with it in their mind.

Whatever the symbol may have meant to Jefferson Davis or Strom Thurmond, it
represents to me every good quality that my parents and community raised me to
value.  This may be an odd concept for an outsider who is only familiar with
the flag as a symbol of racism.  The best way for me to describe it is by
comparing it to the Bible as a symbol of Christianity.  The Old Testament in
particular is filled with ethically questionable pronouncements and actions,
but the vast majority of modern-day Christians have no trouble finding meaning
for their lives within scripture -- regardless of the injustices it has
historically been used to support.

Having said that, when I hear blacks on the other side of the debate critisize
advocates of the Battle Flag, I am forced to reflect on my own feelings, and
it brings to mind a story James Baldwin tells about a trip to the South during
desegregation:

> Now, I talked to many Southern liberals who were doing their best to bring
> integration about in the South, but met scarcely a single Southerner who did
> not weep for the passing of the old order.  They were perfectly sincere,
> too, and within their limits, they were right.  They pointed out how Negroes
> and whites in the South had loved each other, they recounted to me tales of
> devotion and heroism which the old order had produced, and which, now, would
> never come again.  But the old black men I looked at down there -- those
> same black men that the Southern liberal had loved [...] they were not
> weeping.[^1]

When I reflect upon this story, I can't help but feel that I am one of those
"Southern liberals" who weep for an "old order" that never actually existed,
one of those men without the integrity to face their heritage and history
honestly.  It is true that I cannot help the way I feel, but I can help the
actions I take.  And I think if it wouldn't be better to let go of this symbol
of the past, that as much as I cherish it, perhaps it is not worth holding on
to.  The children I may have will likely not be raised in the South.  They
will have no reason to cherish the flag as I do, and I will not expect them
to.  Instead, I will follow the advice of the great Robert E. Lee:

> To a mother, who brought him her two sons, loudly expressing her hatred of
> the North, [Lee] said, "Madam, don't bring up your sons to detest the United
> States Government.  Recollect that we form but one country, now.  Abandon
> all these local animosities, and make your sons Americans."[^2]
